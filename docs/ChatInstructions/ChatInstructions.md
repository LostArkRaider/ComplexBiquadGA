üö® CRITICAL: MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL üö®
‚õî STOP - READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY BEFORE ANY ACTION ‚õî
PHASE 1: ANALYSIS ONLY (NO CODE GENERATION ALLOWED)
You MUST output the following BEFORE writing ANY code:
A. PROJECT UNDERSTANDING (REQUIRED)
    ‚Ä¢ CLEARLY STATE what you understand the task to be
    ‚Ä¢ IDENTIFY all key requirements and constraints
    ‚Ä¢ ACKNOWLEDGE any ambiguities or uncertainties
B. PLANNED ACTIONS (REQUIRED)
    ‚Ä¢ LIST each step you will take, numbered and specific
    ‚Ä¢ EXPLAIN the rationale for your approach
    ‚Ä¢ SPECIFY which modules, structs, and functions you plan to create
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL STOP POINT ‚ö†Ô∏è
After completing Phase 1, you MUST:
    ‚Ä¢ HALT ALL ACTIVITY
    ‚Ä¢ AWAIT EXPLICIT APPROVAL with the words "proceed with code generation"
    ‚Ä¢ DO NOT generate, suggest, or outline any code until given explicit permission

üìã ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL CODE GENERATION
THESE RULES ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE:
    1. ‚úÖ JULIA BEST PRACTICES - Strict adherence to established conventions
    2. üö´ FORBIDDEN: Triple-Quote Comments
        ‚óã Will cause parsing errors
        ‚óã Use # for all comments without exception
    3. üö´ FORBIDDEN: Dictionary-Based Code
        ‚óã Use direct struct definitions ONLY
        ‚óã No Dict() for data structures
    4. üì¶ MANDATORY: Module Structure
        ‚óã ALL code must be within properly defined modules
        ‚óã No loose functions or variables
    5. üìù MANDATORY: Correct Include/Using Order
        ‚óã Verify dependency order before output
        ‚óã Test import sequence validity
    6. üíØ MANDATORY: Complete Files Only
        ‚óã Output ONLY complete, runnable code files via Canvas
        ‚óã NO fragments, NO snippets, NO partial implementations
    7. üõë MANDATORY: Pre-Code Checkpoint
        ‚óã ALWAYS present understanding and plan FIRST
        ‚óã ALWAYS wait for approval BEFORE coding
        ‚óã ALWAYS ask clarifying questions if needed
    8. üö´ FORBIDDEN: No new code files
        ‚óã ALWAYS ask permission before creating a new code file
        ‚óã ALWAYS state the reason why it's better to create a new file than to use the existing file
    9. üö´ FORBIDDEN: No sidelining or bypassing test issues
        ‚óã ALWAYS fix errors as they are encountered
        ‚óã NEVER modify a test to make it easier to pass. 
        ‚óã FIX every issue during testing
        ‚óã Keep a list of bugs that need to be fixed. 
    
‚ùå FAILURE TO COMPLY = PROJECT REJECTION ‚ùå
CONFIRM: Type "UNDERSTOOD - Awaiting task description" to acknowledge these requirements.

When Responding
Output your understanding in the following structure:
    1. Summary of the project (‚â§200 words)
    2. Key components and their roles
    3. My interpretation of the task goals
    4. Planned approach / steps I will take
    5. Clarifying questions (if any)
STOP after this step. Do not generate any code until further instructions.

Project Status

Your tasks
    1. NOTE: YOU ARE INSTRUCTED TO NOTIFY ME IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY Dictionary-Based Code. ANY SUCH CODE WILL NEED TO BE REWRITTEN TO USE DIRECT STRUCTS ONLY. No Dict() is allowed for data structures!
    2. review: project handoff document: 
        ‚óã GA Optimization System - PLL Filter Bank Handoff Document v2.1.md
    3. Review: project specification document:
        ‚óã GA Optimization System for ComplexBiquad PLL Filter Bank - Specification v1.5.md
    4. Request code files that you need to test Chunk 4.
    5. Modify the uploaded load_all.jl script to work with test_chunk4.jl to eliminate Include/Import load sequence issue. 
    6. Test Chunk 4 as described in the project specification document using test_chunk4.jl
    The revised test file includes ALL original test categories:
        ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ RMS-based weight initialization
        ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Scalar weight application
        ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Weight mutation and crossover
        ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Multi-horizon support
        ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks
        ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Integration tests
    PLUS adds:
        ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Phase extrapolation tests
        ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Frequency calculation tests
        ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Mathematical validation
        ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Phase coherence tests
